#How to check if a string is a valid keyword in Python?
The iskeyword method returns True if the passed argument is a valid Python keyword; otherwise, it returns False .


#How to assign values to variables in Python and other languages?
The assignment operator, denoted by the “=” symbol, is the operator that is used to assign values to variables in Python. The line x=1 takes the known value, 1, and assigns that value to the variable with name “x”.


#How to print without newline in Python?
To print without a new line, set the 'end' to a blank string. The Python program below demonstrates how you can use 'end' to print without a new line: print("Hello, world!", end="") print(" This is a single line. ")
this output is 
Hello worldThis is a single line.


#Decision making in Python.
In Python, decision making is achieved by using conditional statements and control structures, such as if and if-else statements. This programming tutorial discusses the concepts and techniques used for decision making in Python, and talks about advanced features such as nested conditionals and boolean expressions.


#Basic calculator program using Python.
def add(P, Q):
This function is used for adding two numbers.
return P + Q.
def subtract(P, Q):
This function is used for subtracting two numbers.
return P - Q.
def multiply(P, Q):
This function is used for multiplying two numbers.
return P*Q.
def division(P, Q):
This function is used for divided two numbers.
return P/Q.
To do this, we need to create a function. Our function will take in three arguments: the two numbers and the operator string. We'll call the function calculate . The calculate function uses conditional statements, which allow you to execute a certain block of code only if a certain condition is met.
